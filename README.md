# MPPT_Converter
A PCB layout I made out of a reference schematic image for a (very very rudimentary) MPPT buck-boost converter.

This was done for a final assignment for an engineering design course - I was initially designing an electric car charging robot with two friends for that assignment, but that got cut short due to COVID.

In this repo is a report outlining my project, a PDF image of the layout, and the Altium design files I created.
